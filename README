Imgyazo

Gyazo that uploads to Imgur instead.


Installing: 
There is no real installer at this moment. You can open "C:\Program Files (x86)\Gyazo\" and replace the "gyazowin.exe" with the one here. 

Usage:
It's exactly the same as the regular Gyazo. You can no longer view the images on gyazo.com, obviously, however all images as well as deletion links are logged to "imgyazo.html" in the Documents folder of the user's home directory.
