Imgyazo

Gyazo that uploads to Imgur instead.


Usage:
Just download [gyazowin.exe](https://github.com/vgmoose/Imgyazo/raw/master/gyazowin.exe) and run it. Then select a portion of the screen and it will upload to Imgur.

Installing (run at start): 
There is no real installer at this moment. You can open "C:\Program Files (x86)\Gyazo\" and replace the "gyazowin.exe" with the one here, or just add the exe to the taskbar. 

Usage:
It's exactly the same as the regular Gyazo. You can no longer view the images on gyazo.com, obviously, however all images as well as deletion links are logged to "imgyazo.html" in the Documents folder of the user's home directory.
